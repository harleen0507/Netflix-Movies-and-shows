# Netflix data cleaning and EDA

## Project Name: Exploratory Analysis of Netflix movie


### Project Overview:
In this exploration, we'll begin by importing a dataset containing metadata for both movies and TV shows.
This dataset includes information such as titles, directors, and casts. We'll then enrich the dataset by introducing additional features.
Our objective is to delve into the data and uncover significant insights and noteworthy discoveries.
## Analysis Objective
This Exploratory Data Analysis is to practice Python skills learned till now on a structured data set including loading, inspecting, wrangling, exploring,
and drawing conclusions from data. The notebook has observations with each step in order to explain thoroughly how to approach the data set.
Based on the observation some questions also are answered in the notebook for the reference though not all of them are explored in the analysis.
